### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)


The `Model` component

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</div>

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* maintains a `VersionedAddressBook` to support undo commands
  * `VersionAddressBook` keeps the current `AddressBook` observed by the UI 
  *  On each command that mutates the database, `Model` will instruct `VersionedAddressBook` to snapshot the current state before executing command so `undo()` can revert to previous version
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

The `Patient` class

* `Patient` extends from `Person`.
* `Patient` would have additional fields `Note` and `Appointment`.
* A `Patient` can have any number of `Note` and `Appointment`.
* `Patient` can have 0 or 1 number of `Caretaker`.

The `Caretaker` class
* `Caretaker` extends from `Person`.
* `Caretaker` must have 1 `Relationship`.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It wraps `AddressBook` with an undo history, stored internally as an internal stack of past states `historyLog`
and a pointer to the current state `current`. It provides the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#update()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Saves the current address book state into the history as a new snapshot.
* `VersionedAddressBook#hasHistory()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Returns `true` if there is at least one previous snapshot of `AddressBook` to restore.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Restores the address book to a previous address book state from history
* `VersionedAddressBook#getAddressBook()` - Exposes live `AddressBook` instance that the UI is connected to

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface
* Model operations that changes its content (e.g `addPerson`, `deletePerson`, `setPerson`, `clear`, `sortPersons`, etc.) calls `VersionedAddressBook#update()`
  to create a snapshot before applying the change
* Model#canUndo() calls `VersionedAddressBook#hasHistory()`
* Model#undo() calls `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` and passes the new filtered list to the UI `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` to refresh the UI list to show the
  list of patients in the latest snapshot of `AddressBook`

#### When we snapshot
Only mutating operations lead to snapshots. The `ModelManager` methods that mutate the book call `update()`, then pperform the change
* Mutating examples which captures snapshot: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `addappt`, `note`
* Non-mutating examples that does not capture snapshot: `list`, `find`, `help`, `sortappt`



#### Example Usage and Behaviour
Step 1: **Initial Launch**
`VersionedAddressBook` will have the initial `AddressBook` state as its `current` property (i.e `current` points to
the newly initialised `AddressBook`

Step 2: **User executes**
```
deletepatient 5
```

Inside `ModeManager.deletePerson()`:
1. `update()` snapshots the **pre-delete** state.
2. Deletes the 5th patient
3. Filtered list refreshes

Step 3: **User executes**
```
patient n/David p/98765432 a/Blk 312 tag/high
```

Inside `ModelManager.addPerson()`:
1. `update()` snapshots the **pre-add** state/
2. Adds the new patient.
3. Filtered list refreshes

New `AddressBook` snapshot is pushed to `historyLog`

Step 4: **User executes**
```undo```
1. `UndoCommand` checks `canUndo()`
2. `model.undo()` -> moves `current` pointer left by one, restores snapshot
   with `resetData(...)`
3. `updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` clears any active filters, so full person UI is displayed

New `AddressBook` snapshot is pushed to `historyLog`


Step 5: **User executes**
```list```
```historyLog``` and ```current``` pointer unchanged. List continues to show all patients.

Step 6: **Behaviour summary**
* Mutating commands (`patient`, `deletepatient`, `edit`, `clear`, `appt`,
  `note`, `sort`) snapshot before changing data
* Undo reverts one step, restore state of latest snapshot captured in `historyLog`, and show all patients
* Non-mutating commands (`list`, `find`, `help`) does not affect content of historyLog.


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Whole-book snapshots in the model
    * Pros:
        * Consistent design, snapshot timing centralized in `ModelManager`
        * Minimal coupling between commands and undo logic;
        * Easier to test
    * Cons:
        * For sessions with large history of commands, can be more memory-intensive

* **Alternative 2:** Command-specific inverse operations
    * Pros:
        * Lower memory (eg: deleted `Patient` for `deletepatient`), potentially faster performance sessions with large history of commands.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement, every mutating command require precise inverse behaviour upon redo
        * Greater risk of encountering bugs across commands
        * Harder to evolve as number of commands increase

Why we chose Alternative 1:
* It keeps our codebase easy to maintain as we add more mutating command. Every reversal follows a history log with minimal guesswork
  and edge cases, strengthening clarity and maintainability of system. We can introduce target optimisations, if memory scale becomes a concern later on


### Appointment feature

#### Overview
The appointment feature lets each `Patient` maintain a chronologically sorted list of upcoming visits. The workflow mirrors the undo/redo walkthrough above: start with a command issued at the CLI, flow through parsing, run model validations, and finally persist the state with undo support. Three commands participate:
* `appt` creates a new appointment for a patient.
* `editappt` updates an existing appointment.
* `deleteappt` removes an appointment.

Each command operates on the currently displayed list, reuses `Command#ensureValidPatientIndex(...)` for index safety, and surfaces results via `Messages.shortFormat(...)` so the UI stays consistent.


#### Example usage scenario
Step 1. The user runs `appt 3 d/31-12-2025 t/13:00 note/Year-end review`. `AddressBookParser` dispatches the command to `AddAppointmentCommandParser`, which validates the prefixes, parses the index, and builds the domain values (`Index`, `String` date/time, optional `Note`).

Step 2. `AddAppointmentCommand#execute(...)` retrieves patient 3 from the filtered list, instantiates a new `Appointment`, and delegates to `ModelManager#addAppointment(...)`.

Step 3. The model performs duplicate checks, creates an updated immutable patient via `Patient#addAppointment(...)`, and replaces the stored patient with `Model#setPerson(...)`. `VersionedAddressBook.update()` snapshots the pre-change state so undo continues to work (the behaviour mirrors the undo/redo diagrams above).

Step 4. The command formats feedback (`Appointment created: <formatted appointment>`) using the freshly constructed appointment rather than relying on list ordering, then returns the `CommandResult` to the UI.

`editappt` and `deleteappt` follow the same lifecycle: parse input, locate the patient, validate the target appointment, produce an updated `Patient` instance, and persist it through the model. Undoing any of these commands restores the previous snapshot just like the undo walkthrough earlier.

#### Command implementation notes
- `AddressBookParser` tokenises raw CLI input and dispatches to the relevant `*AppointmentCommandParser`. Each parser enforces mandatory prefixes, rejects duplicates via `ArgumentMultimap#verifyNoDuplicatePrefixesFor(...)`, and converts user input into domain objects with `ParserUtil`. Parse-time failures throw `ParseException`, surfacing format errors before model work begins.
- `AddAppointmentCommand` constructs the appointment immediately, which ensures invalid dates/times fail fast and allows the same instance to be reused in the success message.
- `EditAppointmentCommand` extends `AbstractEditCommand`. Its `EditAppointmentDescriptor` records only the mutated fields and provides `buildUpdatedAppointment(...)` to merge edits with the original appointment. `validateEdit(...)` performs type checks (patient vs. caretaker), ensures the appointment list is non-empty, and verifies the target index before any model mutation.
- `DeleteAppointmentCommand` extends `AbstractDeleteCommand`. After validation it copies the patientâ€™s appointment list, removes the target entry, and delegates to the model to persist the updated patient.

#### Model updates and undo support
- `ModelManager#addAppointment(...)` is the entry point for creation. It guards against non-`Patient` targets, rebuilds the authoritative `Appointment`, and prevents double booking by comparing date/time pairs. Successful additions call `Patient#addAppointment(...)`, which returns a new immutable patient with a sorted appointment list, before handing control to `setPerson(...)`.
- Editing and deletion follow the same pattern by constructing new `Patient` instances with the edited or trimmed appointment lists. Because every mutation first invokes `VersionedAddressBook.update()`, undo/redo can revert or replay these operations without bespoke logic.
- `Patient` encapsulates appointment storage. Its mutators (`addAppointment`, `editAppointment`) copy the underlying list, apply the change, and sort the result, ensuring consumers never observe partially updated state.

#### Validation and error handling
- `Appointment` performs definitive validation: it parses `dd-MM-yyyy` and `HH:mm` values to `LocalDateTime` and rejects past timestamps via `MESSAGE_PAST_APPOINTMENT`. Optional notes are wrapped in `Note`, inheriting the same length and character checks as patient notes.
- Duplicate detection resides in the model layer rather than the parser so both CLI and future UI surfaces share the same safeguard. Attempts to schedule the same date/time for a patient trigger `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_APPOINTMENT`.
- Editing supports note removal by treating empty `p/n` inputs as `EditAppointmentDescriptor#clearNote()`. The descriptor tracks this through the `noteCleared` flag and `isAnyFieldEdited()` prevents no-op updates from reaching the model.

#### Testing guidance
- `AddAppointmentCommandTest`, `EditAppointmentCommandTest`, and `DeleteAppointmentCommandTest` cover the command flows, including duplicate detection, invalid indices, and success messaging.
- Parser-focused coverage in `AddAppointmentCommandParserTest`, `EditAppointmentCommandParserTest`, and `DeleteAppointmentCommandParserTest` verifies prefix handling, optional note parsing, and error reporting for malformed indices.
- `PatientTest` and `AppointmentTest` verify list immutability, chronological ordering, and validation logic so downstream commands can rely on the documented invariants.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Where to enforce appointment invariants**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Validate in the model layer (`Appointment`, `ModelManager`).
   * Pros: Guarantees consistency for all entry points (CLI, potential GUI).
   * Cons: Commands need to surface validation errors up to the UI.
* **Alternative 2:** Validate in individual commands and parsers.
   * Pros: Simpler error messaging per command.
   * Cons: Tight coupling, duplicated checks, and increased risk when introducing new entry points.
